# haar_distribution

haar_distributed_unitary.py contains a class called haar_distribution which acts as the uniform distribution on unitary matrices. The class allows you to generate samples and access the distribution function. Relies on unitary_stuffs.py to construct unitary matrices. 

unitary_stuffs.py contains methods for constructing unitary matrices from a given d by d matrix of parameters. Used by haar_distributed_unitary.py to produce a sample of unitary matrices.
